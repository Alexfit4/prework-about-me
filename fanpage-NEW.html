      <h2>Bio</h2>
    
      <p>Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (born March 10, 1994), known by his stage name Bad Bunny, is a Puerto Rican singer, rapper, and songwriter.
        His music is often defined as Latin trap and reggaeton, but he has incorporated various other genres into his music, including rock, bachata, and soul. 
        He is also known for his deep, slurred vocal style and his eclectic fashion sense. 
        Throughout his career, Bad Bunny has frequently collaborated with artists such as J Balvin, Ozuna, Farruko, Residente, Arcángel, and Daddy Yankee.

      <p>Born and raised in the municipality of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny gained popularity on SoundCloud and was eventually signed to a record label while working in a supermarket as a bagger and studying at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. 
        Following the release of his breakthrough single "Soy Peor" in late 2016, he rose to stardom after collaborating with Cardi B and Drake on the singles "I Like It" and "Mia", which charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number one and number three, respectively. 
        His debut album X 100pre (2018) was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Music Album. His collaborative album with J Balvin, Oasis (2019), contains the popular singles "Qué Pretendes" and "La Canción".

        In early 2020, he performed at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show as a guest, alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez,[3] and became the first Latin urban music artist on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Bad Bunny's second studio album, YHLQMDLG (Yo hago lo que me da la gana) (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the US Billboard 200 at number two and released the compilation album Las que no iban a salir (2020), two months later without prior announcement or promotion.
